1. For networking on windows, you need to link to the following library: ws2_32.lib.
2. Don't forget to copy over all the dll's you're using to the bin directory (can be done in a post-build event), like so:
    <PostBuildEvent>
      <Command>copy "$(OPENCV_X86)\bin\opencv_world300.dll" "$(OutDir)"</Command>
    </PostBuildEvent>
   For debug configuration - don't forget to add a 'd' at the end of the dll name
3. An example of setting an environment variable: (type in an administrator cmd window)
	setx -m OPENCV_X86 D:\OpenCV\Build\x86\vc12
